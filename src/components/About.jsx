              The key to achieve our goals are hard work, dedication and
              commitment. This is what I always try to apply in every project
              I start. After spending more than 9 years
              as a computer-oriented administrative employee, I decided to
              change the course of my life by focusing on what I really like,
              which is programming. <br />I am open to any type of work and my
              schedule is super flexible.
